## Bark Farmers

### Web Presence
Bark farmers is a firewood and smoking wood wholesaler in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. A Google search for "indianapolis firewood" places them 14th in business links, and web links don't return them at all. It is also registered as a "Fishing area!" The only reason it registers at all is because of a review that mentions firewood.

I will be taking over the Google Business account to correct this and address some of the negative reviews.

I have arranged a meeting with the owner to make the following feature suggestions for a potential website:


### Splash page
Three sections: 
- Large hero image with call to action
- Quick information with links to more reading elsewhere
- Final call to action

### Meeting Notes:
Client was apathetic about the splash page, so I'll be building it however I want.
***
### About page 
- Info about Bark Farmers
- Info about wood-borne pests and creosote
- Certifications
- Accolades?

### Meeting Notes:
Client was apathetic about the about page, so I'll be building it to improve the site from an evaluator's perspective
***
### Consumer grade products page
1. Order for delivery
    - Stacking
    - Control delivery range
    - Could be connected to a calendar but would require client to use a calendar app
    - Wood subscription service, aka regular deliveries of wood: billed, delivered and stacked without input

2. Order for pickup
    - Schedule loading as a service, i.e. handloading is more expensive, forklift into a truckbed is cheaper
        - Scheduled pickups could have some sort of "You need to book 24 hours ahead of time" thing

### Meeting Notes:
Client was pleased with the features as suggested. The client also has an existing price list that can be expanded to include the loading fee suggested here.

There are also other concerns that the developer was not aware of, like varying qualities and types of wood.

### Commercial Services
There are two ways to go about this: Anyone can create a commercial account, or new commercial accounts are generated from an admin account
1. Login/account management
    - Change email, email notification settings
    - Change password
2. Transaction history
    - Customer can view invoice history
3. Outstanding invoices
    - View expected delivery dates
    - View and pay outstanding invoices
4. Product availability
    - View available products
    - can come with a "may not be 100% accurate" message with a prompt to call for up-to-the-minute information
5. Place orders
    - Repeating
    - single

### Meeting notes:
The client is pleased with the commercial services page as suggested. It addresses all of the core business concerns that the client was interested in, and more.

## StoneScapes
Stonescapes By Design is a partner company under the same client. The client decided against including Stonescapes in the design, so it will not be added.

# The 5 Elements

## Strategy
Bark Farmers is an established commercial firewood producer/distributer in Indianapolis, IN. It has an established commercial customerbase which comprises the bulk of its business. It has much less direct consumer sales and a shaky web presence, especially compared to direct competitors in the region. Thus, the philosophy of the site will be to draw in direct-to-consumer customers with a clean, streamlined interface, while also adding a businesslike landing page with features to help retain future and current commercial customers.

### Targeted audience
1. Current consumers
2. New consumers
3. Current commercial customers
4. New commercial customers

### Current Consumers:
As a current consumer I:
- Want a clean and easy to use system
- Want to feel safe entering my payment details
- Want to compare prices and services

### New Consumers:
As a new consumer I:
- Want to learn about the benefits of kiln-dried firewood
- Want a clean and easy to use system
- Want to feel safe entering my payment details
- Want to compare prices and services

### Current Commercial Customers:
As a current commercial customer I:
- Want an intuitive, simple interface 
- Want access to transactional records
- Want to see what services and products are currently available
- Want to view and settle open invoices
- Want to feel safe entering my payment details

### New Commercial Customers:
As a new commercial customer I:
- Want to see a professional-seeming website
- Want to preview what a commercial account entails
- Want an intuitive, simple interface 
- Want to request a commercial account

***
## Scope

The site should be simple enough to appeal to someone who "just wants to hop on and order some wood" while retaining enough features to be powerful. It should also be a professional presentation to attract and retain commercial customers.

### Functional requirements
Note: there is some overlap between the grades.

Consumer-grade:  
- Splash page
- Store page
- Shopping cart
- Payment processing
- Limited delivery range

Commercial-grade:
- Login
- Account Management
- Product Availability
- Place order

### Content requirements
Consumer-grade:
- Smooth, modern design with intuitive, simple features
- Product images

Commercial grade:
- Invoices

### Optional Features
![alt text](assets/images/readme/viability-importance-grid.jpg)
- Subscription services

    Subscription services would take a lot more work than a traditional transaction, and so represent a "reach goal" for the site. However, the potential to create automatically recurring customers would be very valuable to the company.

- Commercial Transaction History

    A commercial transaction history would consist of downloadable PDFs and/or the ability to request a PDF of a particular invoice. This would require the client working within the system more, as well as some work with storing PDFs for retrieval.

- Store page animations

    Store page animations would have smooth animations when clicking on store items to create a connection between elements and make the experience more intuitive. This would be accomplished primarily with CSS and JS systems.

- Commercial page animations

    Commercial page animations would make the interface more complex but more intuitive, with items emerging from their constituent elements to emphasize their connection.

## Structure
### Interaction design

### Information Architecture
Information architecture will be thoroughly designed when we know more about what information will be stored and how.

***
## Skeleton
### Interface design

The "splash" or front page is the hub. The nav bar and background on the splash page serve as the unifying element between all consumer pages. The aim is to create the feel of a single-page website with progressive revelation between all of the consumer areas, including login and account management. The goal is to streamline the process of getting to the payment page as much as possible.

### Navigation design
### Information design
***
## Surface
### Color scheme
    #FAFAFA
    #000000
### Typography
#### Interface elements:
The existing logo has been with the company since inception, and thus the developer is choosing Libre Baskerville for interface elements to match the serif font of the logo.
#### Information elements:
For a cleaner look to paragraphs and other information blocks, Montserrat has been chosen.
