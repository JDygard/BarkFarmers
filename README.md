## Bark Farmers

### Web Presence
Bark farmers is a firewood and smoking wood wholesaler in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. A Google search for "indianapolis firewood" places them 14th in business links, and web links don't return them at all. It is also registered as a "Fishing area!" The only reason it registers at all is because of a review that mentions firewood.

I will be taking over the Google Business account to correct this and address some of the negative reviews.

I have arranged a meeting with the owner to make the following feature suggestions for a potential website:


### Splash page
Three sections: 
- Large hero image with call to action
- Quick information with links to more reading elsewhere
- Final call to action

### About page 
- Info about Bark Farmers
- Info about wood-borne pests and creosote
- Certifications
- Accolades?

### Consumer grade products page
1. Order for delivery
    - Stacking
    - Control delivery range
    - Could be connected to a calendar but would require Alec to use a calendar app
    - Wood subscription service, aka regular deliveries of wood: billed, delivered and stacked without input

2. Order for pickup
    - Schedule loading as a service, i.e. handloading is more expensive, forklift into a truckbed is cheaper
        - Scheduled pickups could have some sort of "You need to book 24 hours ahead of time" thing

### Commercial Services
There are two ways to go about this: Anyone can create a commercial account, or new commercial accounts are generated from an admin account
1. Login/account management
    - Change email, email notification settings
    - Change password
2. Transaction history
    - Customer can view invoice history
3. Outstanding invoices
    - View expected delivery dates
    - View and pay outstanding invoices
4. Product availability
    - View available products
    - can come with a "may not be 100% accurate" message with a prompt to call for up-to-the-minute information
5. Place orders
    - Repeating
    - single
