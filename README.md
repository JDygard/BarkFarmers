## Bark Farmers

### Web Presence
Bark farmers is a firewood and smoking wood wholesaler in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. A Google search for "indianapolis firewood" places them 14th in business links, and web links don't return them at all. It is also registered as a "Fishing area!" The only reason it registers at all is because of a review that mentions firewood.

I will be taking over the Google Business account to correct this and address some of the negative reviews.

I have arranged a meeting with the owner to make the following feature suggestions for a potential website:


### Splash page
Three sections: 
- Large hero image with call to action
- Quick information with links to more reading elsewhere
- Final call to action

### Meeting Notes:
Client was apathetic about the splash page, so I'll be building it however I want.
***
### About page 
- Info about Bark Farmers
- Info about wood-borne pests and creosote
- Certifications
- Accolades?

### Meeting Notes:
Client was apathetic about the about page, so I'll be building it to improve the site from an evaluator's perspective

### Consumer grade products page
1. Order for delivery
    - Stacking
    - Control delivery range
    - Could be connected to a calendar but would require client to use a calendar app
    - Wood subscription service, aka regular deliveries of wood: billed, delivered and stacked without input

2. Order for pickup
    - Schedule loading as a service, i.e. handloading is more expensive, forklift into a truckbed is cheaper
        - Scheduled pickups could have some sort of "You need to book 24 hours ahead of time" thing

### Meeting Notes:
Client was pleased with the features as suggested. The client also has an existing price list that can be expanded to include the loading fee suggested here.

There are also other concerns that the developer was not aware of, like varying qualities and types of wood.

### Commercial Services
There are two ways to go about this: Anyone can create a commercial account, or new commercial accounts are generated from an admin account
1. Login/account management
    - Change email, email notification settings
    - Change password
2. Transaction history
    - Customer can view invoice history
3. Outstanding invoices
    - View expected delivery dates
    - View and pay outstanding invoices
4. Product availability
    - View available products
    - can come with a "may not be 100% accurate" message with a prompt to call for up-to-the-minute information
5. Place orders
    - Repeating
    - single

### Meeting notes:
The client is pleased with the commercial services page as suggested. It addresses all of the core business concerns that the client was interested in, and more.

## StoneScapes
Stonescapes By Design is a partner company under the same client. The client decided against including Stonescapes in the design, so it will not be added.
